# Serial-Generator
I was thinking today that I need again Serial lists for my purchase onyl Programms and online I can't find a free serial list generator, so I amde this Project.

## Setup
First you need Install the required Packages so the Program can work.

`pip install random`

`pip install json`

`pip install time`

`pip install pathlib`

After We done this we are going to setup what we want have for serials. First we want to set the lengh of our serial keyes by settiing the variable `serial_lengh = 20` to our decided lengh of the Serial Key.

Then we can decide how many Serials we want to generate. For that we edit the variable `serial_amout = 5000` to the amout of Serials we want to generate.

start_text = "sgen_"
chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
